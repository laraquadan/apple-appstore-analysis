# Apple App Store Data Analysis and Modeling
***
The project aims on helping app store developers to develop successful trending new apps. The project applies the CRISP-DM Data Science process to get insight about the data. It consists of two parts: The analysis part, where some questions that maybe interesting for the developers regarding how to get high rating for thier next app are answered using data visualization. In the second part a user rating Linear Regression Model is developed to predict the user rating based on the app features.
This work is part of the requirements for ```Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree```. The Dataset is downloaded from ```www.kaggle.com```
# Getting Started
***
The project consists of two files: 
 1. jupyter note book file: App Store Application Data Analysis and Modeling.ipynb
 2. Html file: App Store Application Data Analysis and Modeling.html
 3. App Store data file: AppleStore.csv 

### Prerequisits 
To be able to run the code you need:
 - A machine with python 3 installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
**Make sure the following python packages are installed:**
 - Numpy
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn
## Installing
After making sure all required packages are installed you need to follow these steps:
 1. Download or clone the project to your local machine. After downloading you need to make sure that you have two
files in the same directry:
    - jupyter note book file: App Store Application Data Analysis and Modeling.ipynb
    - App Store data file: AppleStore.csv
2. Open Anaconda Navigator: 
    **Windows**
    From the Start menu, click the Anaconda Navigator desktop app
    **macOS**
    Open Launchpad, then click the Anaconda Navigator icon.
    **Linux**
    open a terminal window and type:
    ```sh
    $ anaconda-navigator
    ```
3. From the Navigator window select under Jupyter Notebook click ```Launch```, This will open Jupyter in your browser.
4. From the ```Files``` tab select the notebook file ```App Store Application Data Analysis and Modeling.ipynb``` this will open the notebook file. 
Now you can start running and forking the code.

### Results
The analysis of the data shows:
- There are category of apps like Games, Entertainment, Education and Video apps that are most interesting for App Store users.
- Users give pricedd apps higher ratings.
- For a successful app the number of supported devices is very important for users.
- A Linear Regression Model for predicting the user rating for a new app was developed with around 86% accurecy.
